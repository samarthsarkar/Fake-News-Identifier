# Fake-News-Identifier


Techstack details and technicalities:
    Machine learning with a 'PassiveAggressiveClassifier' model was used to develop the backend.
    Prewritten dataset news.csv was used as the primary dataset to implement machine learning in the learning algorithm.
    The backend was developed using jupyter notebook and a python program.
    The frontend is developed using HTML and cascading style sheet files.
    
Brief Structural description:
    A resizable textbox is provided to input the textual content from the news dataset followed by a trigger button to give the necessary output.
    A special clock feature displaying real time take from system clock was implemented using an embedded java script code into the HTML file itself.
    The result webpage also has links to 4 other reliable news websites and 4 websites related to covid-19 resources to highlight the ongoing pandemic situation and if possible       provide aid.
    An animated background has been implemented to make the website look more visually appeasing.
